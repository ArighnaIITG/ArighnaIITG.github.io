Phase 2 of the GSoC coding period is coming to an end. !! I and Sartaj had a meeting on the **18th of July**, about the timeline of the next 4 weeks. Here are the deliverables that have been completed in this week, including the minutes of the meeting.

  - The `FiniteFormalPowerSeries` underwent a lot of changes. Firstly as had been discussed in the earlier meetings, that the `order` term in the `compose`, `inverse` and `product` functions need to be removed, so that the existing methods in `FormalPowerSeries` work upon it. So, I introduced three new subclasses of `FiniteFormalPowerSeries`, which were `FormalPowerSeriesCompose`, `FormalPowerSeriesInverse`, and `FormalPowerSeriesProduct` respectively. Now the three functions returned these three classes respectively. 
  
  All the three classes had a custom `_eval_terms` function, which basically contains the logic of changing the various infinite sequences into terms. Note that all functions of `FormalPowerSeries` were based on point by point logic, i.e. if you give a `pt`, you will get the `pt`th term. Here the calculation is based on term by term logic, i.e., given `n` you can get `n` terms upto that specified order.
  
  The documentation for the three classes will give you much more clarity.
  The following is for `FormalPowerSeriesProduct`. The examples are given for the `eval_terms` function described in the class.
  
```javascript
class FormalPowerSeriesProduct(FiniteFormalPowerSeries):
    """Represents the product of two formal power series of two functions.
    
    No computation is performed. Terms are calculated using a term by term logic,
    instead of a point by point logic.
    
    There are two differences between a `FormalPowerSeries` object and a
    `FormalPowerSeriesProduct` object. The first argument contains the two
    functions involved in the product. Also, the coefficient sequence contains
    both the coefficient sequence of the formal power series of the involved functions.

    >>> fprod._eval_terms(4)
    x**3/3 + x**2 + x

   The following is for `FormalPowerSeriesCompose`. The examples are given for the `eval_terms` function described in the class.
   
```javascript
class FormalPowerSeriesCompose(FiniteFormalPowerSeries):
    """Represents the composed formal power series of two functions.
    No computation is performed. Terms are calculated using a term by term logic,
    instead of a point by point logic.
    
    There are two differences between a `FormalPowerSeries` object and a
    `FormalPowerSeriesCompose` object. The first argument contains the outer
    function and the inner function involved in the omposition. Also, the
    coefficient sequence contains the generic sequence which is to be multiplied
    by a custom `bell_seq` finite sequence. The finite terms will then be added up to
    get the final terms.

    >>> fcomp = f1.compose(f2, x)
    
    >>> fcomp._eval_terms(6)
    -x**5/15 - x**4/8 + x**2/2 + x + 1
    
    >>> fcomp._eval_terms(8)
    x**7/90 - x**6/240 - x**5/15 - x**4/8 + x**2/2 + x + 1

    """
```

   The following is for `FormalPowerSeriesInverse`. The examples are given for the `eval_terms` function described in the class.
   
```javascript
class FormalPowerSeriesInverse(FiniteFormalPowerSeries):
    """Represents the Inverse of a formal power series.
    
    No computation is performed. Terms are calculated using a term by term logic,
    instead of a point by point logic.
    
    There is a single difference between a `FormalPowerSeries` object and a
    `FormalPowerSeriesInverse` object. The coefficient sequence contains the
    generic sequence which is to be multiplied by a custom `bell_seq` finite sequence.
    The finite terms will then be added up to get the final terms.

  For more changes, you are welcome to look into [PR #17134](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/17134). Note that these are subclasses of `FiniteFormalPowerSeries` class, which actually contains the common `polynomial` function, and also the `NotImplemented` functions as well.
  
  That's it for this week. See you in the next week and the last phase. Till then, Adios!!
