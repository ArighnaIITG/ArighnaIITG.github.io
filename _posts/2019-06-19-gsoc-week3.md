Week 3 of the first phase of this coding period is coming to an end. The week started with a bad note, given that I had fallen sick due to travelling. But the work in Week 2, and the meeting with **Sartaj** on **11th of June** helped me to progress smoothly. This week was spent mostly in completing the following deliverables.

   - This week was spent mostly in deciding the ways to implement the various operations in `Formal Power Series`. I started with `convolution` since I felt that was the only operation which didn't require a tough recursive implementation. `Discrete convolution`, or specifically `Cauchy Product` of two infinite series goes as following --

Keeping this in mind, Sartaj and I decided to first make a boiler-plate function `convolve` which will take in two functions, `f(x)` and `g(x)` and an `order` term and will return the convolved formal power series, truncated upto the order term. I then came up with [PR #17017](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/17017), which does this following operations --

```javascript
>>> f1, f2 = fps(sin(x)), fps(exp(x))
>>> f1.convolute(f2, x, order=6)
x + x**2 + x**3/3 - x**5/12 + O(x**6)
```
Note that no `FormalPowerSeries` object is being returned as of now. We will deal with that in the upcoming PR.

   - After pushing in the PR, Sartaj suggested to turn all the implementations in the `convolve` functions inot sequence-based implemetations, since `Sequences` in general should also cache the coefficients and speed for later calls as well. I used the `convolution` function in `sympy.discrete.convolutions` and have implemented `linear`, `cyclic`, `dyadic` and `subset` convolution as of now in `convolve` function of formal power series. Some examples are --
   
```javascript
>>> from sympy import fps, sin, exp, convolution
>>> from sympy.abc import x
>>> f1 = fps(sin(x))
>>> f2 = fps(exp(x))

>>> f1.convolve(f2, x, 4)
x + x**2 + x**3/3 + O(x**4)

>>> f1.convolve(f2, x, 4, cycle=4)
11*x/12 + 35*x**2/36 + x**3/3 + O(x**4)

>>> f1.convolve(f2, x, 6, dyadic=True)
4667/4800 + 2641*x/2880 + x**3/3 + x**4/60 + x**5/20 + O(x**6)

>>> f1.convolve(f2, x, 6, subset=True)
x + x**3/3 + x**5/20 + O(x**6)
```

The PR is in a position of receiving final reviews and getting merged !!

  - In the meeting with Sartaj, we also discussed how we can decide upon the implementation of `composition` and `inversion` of formal power series. We decided that we should create a `FiniteFormalPowerSeries` class inherited from `FormalPowerSeries` and use that for implementing the various operations, so that common functions can be re-used. Soon, I will be implementing a `PR` for the above mentioned topics.
  
That's it for Week 3 !! See you in the next week.
