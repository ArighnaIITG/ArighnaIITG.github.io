Sorry for the late post!!

The results of **[Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5481256685404160)** were out on 6th of May 2019. I was overjoyed to see that I was selected as a student, under **[Sympy](http://sympy.org)** , an organization in which I had been contributing for the past 1+ year. My project for the summer will be [Improving Series Expansions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SImlbrM082Wkwk__DfmA6asteh--XypkV-B0TsxOOSU/edit), and I will be working with **Sartaj Singh** as my mentor, whose work inspired me in the first place, to write this proposal. I am really excited to work with such an amazing organization. I would like to thank all the people especially [Aaron Meurer](https://github.com/asmeurer), [Christopher Smith](https://github.com/smichr), and [Kalevi Suominen](https://github.com/jksuom) for guiding me in my proposal and PR's.


The first phase is the _Community Bonding Period_, and I will be focusing on the following things before the coding period begins.


 - Setting up a personal GSoC blog and synchronizing it with `planet sympy`. The blog requires a RSS feed to be integrated with it.

 - Discussing possible means of communication, weekly meetings etc, and planning the implementation of the project with Sartaj.

 - Familiarizing with the codebase of Sympy and see how it may help solving the problems while implementing the project.
 
 - Start thinking about the first task :- `Correcting XFAIL tests in test_formal.py`.


I will be having my end sems and practicals during the first half of this period but I will try to accomplish the above tasks whenever I get time.

Looking forward for a wonderful summer ahead ðŸ˜„	!!
