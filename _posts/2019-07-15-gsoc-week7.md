Phase 2 of the coding period is smoothly being traversed. I recently had a meeting with **Sartaj** on 11th of July, Thursday. Here were the minutes of the meeting, along with the deliverables completed over the week.

   - The `FiniteFormalPowerSeries` class PR needs some changes. Currently, it is taking in an 'order' term and returning a  `FiniteFormalPowerSeries` class object, in which the coefficient sequence is a list of coefficients. **Sartaj** said that there is no point in keeping a class if we are describing it for only this functionality. Instead, he suggested that we should not take in an `order` term, and try to return only sequences,such that all the functionalities are working properly. I am currently working on the class PR. It should be ready and be in a mergeable position by the next week.
   
   - The `aseries` functionality is ready and has been pushed in [PR #17167](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/17167). Here is the functionality which has been implemented.
   
```javascript

def aseries(expr, x=None, n=6, bound=0, hir=False):
    """Asymptotic Series expansion of expr.
    This is equivalent to ``expr.series(x, oo, n)``.
    
    Parameters
    ==========
    
    expr : Expression
           The expression whose series is to be expanded.
    x : Symbol
        It is the variable of the expression to be calculated.
    n : Value
        The number of terms upto which the series is to be expanded.
    hir : Boolean
          Set this parameter to be True to produce hierarchical series.
          It stops the recursion at an early level and may provide nicer
          and more useful results.
    bound : Value, Integer
            Use the ``bound`` parameter to give limit on rewriting
            coefficients in its normalised form.
      
    Examples
    ========
    
    >>> from sympy import sin, exp
    >>> from sympy.abc import x, y
    
    >>> e = sin(1/x + exp(-x)) - sin(1/x)
    >>> e.aseries(x)
    (1/(24*x**4) - 1/(2*x**2) + 1 + O(x**(-6), (x, oo)))*exp(-x)
    
    >>> e.aseries(x, n=3, hir=True)
    -exp(-2*x)*sin(1/x)/2 + exp(-x)*cos(1/x) + O(exp(-3*x), (x, oo))
    
    >>> e = exp(exp(x)/(1 - 1/x))
    >>> e.aseries(x, bound=3)
    exp(exp(x)/x**2)*exp(exp(x)/x)*exp(-exp(x) + exp(x)/(1 - 1/x) - exp(x)/x - exp(x)/x**2)*exp(exp(x))
    
    >>> e.aseries(x)
    exp(exp(x)/(1 - 1/x))
    
    Returns
    =======
    
    Expr
        Asymptotic series expansion of the expression.
        
    Notes
    =====
    
    This algorithm is directly induced from the limit computational algorithm provided by Gruntz.
    It majorly uses the mrv and rewrite sub-routines. The overall idea of this algorithm is first
    to look for the most rapidly varying subexpression w of a given expression f and then expands f
    in a series in w. Then same thing is recursively done on the leading coefficient
    till we get constant coefficients.
    
    If the most rapidly varying subexpression of a given expression f is f itself,
    the algorithm tries to find a normalised representation of the mrv set and rewrites f
    using this normalised representation.
    
    If the expansion contains an order term, it will be either ``O(x**(-n))`` or ``O(w**(-n))``
    where ``w`` belongs to the most rapidly varying expression of ``self``.
```
