Phase 2 of the coding period is smoothly being traversed. I recently had a meeting with **Sartaj** on 4th of July, Thursday. Here were the minutes of the meeting, along with the deliverables completed over the week.

   - The meeting commenced with the discussion that we need to wrap up the work that I had proposed in the domain of `Formal Power Series`. In lieu of this, I started off with the left-over portion in [PR #17017](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/17017). The minor change involved changing the name of the function API to `product` from `convolve`, since it is currently only handling the linear infinite cycle convolution case. Also the tests were updated suitably. After pushing in all the changes, and a final review, the PR got merged 4 days ago !!
   
   - The next objective was to finish off [PR #17064](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/17064). Now merging [PR #17017](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/17017) introduced merge conflicts in this PR. So, I had to solve those merge conflicts (5 of them), and then presented it for final review. There was still a bug in the `compose` function. I was mistakenly using `self.ind` to fill in the constant term, instead of doing `self._eval_term(0)`. I fixed that bug, optimised the code a little. I also checked the various test cases from various online references, and it came to my notice that `fps(sin(sin(x)))` was giving a wrong answer in my code. I fixed the logic of the function, and then documented the correct test case. The PR got merged yesterday.
   
   - The last work in this domain was to complete the `FiniteFormalPowerSeries` class [PR #17134](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/17134). First I had to pull in the master into the local branch, since the changes in the previous PRs needed to be reflected in tis branch. Then I made all the functions return objects of `FiniteFormalPowerSeries` class. The class presently contains only one overriden `_eval_term` function. Since `FiniteFormalPowerSeries` is a derived class of `FormalPowerSeries` class, there are some methods which cannot be implemented for objects of the finite version of the class, like `integrate` or `_eval_derivative`. Those functions are presently returning a `NotImplementedError`. Also the logic of the three functions had to be tweaked a liitle.
   
   Finally the output is looking somewhat like this --
  
```javascript
>>> from sympy import *
>>> x = symbols('x')
>>> f1, f2 = fps(exp(x)), fps(sin(x))

>>> f1.compose(f2)
FiniteFormalPowerSeries(exp(sin(x)), x, 0, 1, ([1, 1/2, 0, -1/8, -1/15], SeqFormula(x**_k, (_k, 0, oo)), 1))

>>> f1.compose(f2).truncate(6)
1 + x + x**2/2 - x**4/8 - x**5/15 + O(x**6)

>>> f1.inverse()
FiniteFormalPowerSeries(exp(-x), x, 0, 1, ([-1, 1/2, -1/6, 1/24, -1/120], SeqFormula(x**_k, (_k, 0, oo)), 1))

>>> f1.inverse().truncate(6)
1 - x + x**2/2 - x**3/6 + x**4/24 - x**5/120 + O(x**6)
```

The test cases have been well documented. The PR is in a state of review and merge !!

  - Next we started to decide about what to do next. The next topic in my proposal was `Improving limits module`. The first task was to implement `Shackell's algorithm`, which was an alternate version of the famous `Gruntz algorithm`, which SymPy currently uses. Sartaj told me to look upon resources which talk about Shackell's algorithm.
