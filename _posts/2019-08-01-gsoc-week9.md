The last phase of this journey has started. I am happy to let you know that I have passed Phase 2 successfully. Phase 3 will include merging of some important code written in Phase 2, and also implementation of some other useful code. I had a meeting with **Sartaj** in which we discussed about the deliverables to be completed in the last phase.

  - The `FormalPowerSeries class` PR has undergone a lot of changes. There has been quite a number of API changes, inorder to make the subclasses more usable by the users. The wrapper `FiniteFormalPowerSeries` class now looks somewhat like this :--

```javascript
class FiniteFormalPowerSeries(FormalPowerSeries):
    """Base Class for Product, Compose and Inverse classes"""

    def __init__(self, *args):
        pass

    @property
    def ffps(self):
        return self.args[0][0]

    @property
    def gfps(self):
        return self.args[0][1]

    @property
    def f(self):
        return self.ffps.function

    @property
    def g(self):
        return self.gfps.function

    @property
    def infinite(self):
        raise NotImplementedError("No infinite version for an object of"
                     " FiniteFormalPowerSeries class.")
    
    def _eval_terms(self, n):
        raise NotImplementedError("(%s)._eval_terms()" % self)

    def _eval_term(self, pt):
        raise NotImplementedError("By the current logic, one can get terms"
                                   "upto a certain order, instead of getting term by term.")

    def polynomial(self, n):
        return self._eval_terms(n)

    def _eval_derivative(self, x):
        raise NotImplementedError

    def integrate(self, x):
        raise NotImplementedError
```

As you can see, there are four properties namely `ffps` (the `Formal Power Series` of the first function). `gfps`(the `Formal Power Series` of the second function), and `f` and `g`, which are the two functions respectively. This was done so that the API of the three subclasses can be changed to, for example `FormalPowerSeriesCompose((self, other), self.x, self.x0, self.dir, ((self.bell_coeff_seq,), self.xk, self.ind))`.

We pass `formal power series` instead of `functions`, since the computation in the `_eval_terms()` function in the three subclasses will be quite easy.

  - I also started working on the PR which implements `aseries` function for various special functions. I hav e already implemented for `erf` variants. The PR should be ready by the next week.
  Also the suggestions provided by Sartaj on the first `aseries` [PR #17167](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/17167), have been integrated. You can view them in the PR.
  
  That's it for this week. See you in the next week.
